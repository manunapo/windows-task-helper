# windows-task-helper

Hello

This  application aims to provide a shorcut to common user taks, like accesing common computer folder, browse pages or more actions to be defined.

A global hot key, and actions are defined via config.json, so when you press it, a small text box will appear at the top of the screen, where you can enter a set of predefined actions to excecute defined tasks.

On my day by day basis is quite often to check the same confluence pages, open the custmers folder or remote connection to different servers. With this helper i can input this actions from keyboard in one hit.
